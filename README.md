# More Select Filters
New overly complicated menu with more select filters.

## How To Use
you dont get grammar for this :3

main feature of this mod is having arrays of filters instead of just one, you can seperate values with ","

other than everything in the fitler menu there are 3 buttons

- the left button** clears every filter input
- the ok button saves your filter
- the right button is a shortcut to select all objects

in the actual filter menu

- the inputs are the inputs go figure
- the equals/not equals button toggles checking if any match or all dont match
- the delete button clears the input
- the object button copies values from the currently selected object(s)

for actually inputting things

- for object id, groups, and z order input numbers (default for default z order)
- for layers input b5, b4, t1, t2, etc (also default for default layer)
- for scale input a number then x/y for x/y scale, and a number without any suffix for both
- for color input a number or a special color (obj, bg, black, etc...)
- for hsv input a number then h, s, or v/b
- for type input any of (layout, trigger, decoration/deco, passable, detail, hazard, solid)
